# Hello there

Welcome to reference this for your own projects for Upenn CIS521 Articial Intelligence.

This repo contains some answers to the assignments of the course. What is worth mentinoning is that the course is actually a simplifed version of Berkeley [CS 188](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/) Intro to AI. 

While other repo might be a bit complex and messy, I tried to keep this one clean and simple.

While some early assignment i fail one or two autograder test, most others i passed all. See commit history to know if the answer passed all the tests.
